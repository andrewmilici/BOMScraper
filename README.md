# BOMScraper
 A small utility to scrape the BOM (Bureau of Meteorology) website to get current weather data

## Why?
I like to have weather data emailed to me, so I wrote a small script to get the latest weather data delivered to my inbox.

## But there are heaps of weather APIs out there, why a scraper?
Wheres the fun in that? Theres a sense of accomplishment when you can reverse engineer something.

## Any tips if I want to use this? 
I would suggest that writing the results of the BOM scraper to a local storage facility first, before displaying them to the user. This allows connectivity issues to occur with BOM and not impede the user experience with unessecary runtime errors.
